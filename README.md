Music Hack Day 2014 hack using Bare Conductive Touch Board

Floor mat that shows the steps to the waltz. The Waltz of the Flowers progresses as you dance.

Uses Bare Conductive's Electric Paint and Touch Board. The "footsteps" are painted capacitive sensors that trigger the next set of MIDI notes. All is done on board including MIDI and audio - no laptop involved.

Used MuseScore to transcribe excerpt from MIDI file to Arduino code.
